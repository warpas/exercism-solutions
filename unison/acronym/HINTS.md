# Hints

## General

- This exercise works with textual data and lists. Unison `Text` values can be unpacked into a list of `Char` and back to `Text` again. The UCM supports a "find by type" utility which may be useful for finding relevant functions.
- Try entering `find : Text -> [Char]` in the UCM command line to see what comes up. The colon `:` is what indicates that we're searching by type rather than by name. [Read more about the `find` command here.](https://www.unison-lang.org/learn/ucm-commands/#find)
- You can also browse functions for the `Text` type and functions for the `List` type online at [Unison share.](https://share.unison-lang.org/@unison/code/latest/namespaces/public/base/latest)
