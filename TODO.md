## Intimate Introduction - January

- [x] featured month badge

## The rules

An exercise must be published during 2023.
You can complete/publish them at any time during the year not just the featured month.
You need to complete each exercise in at least one languages (it’s not required to complete it in all the featured languages)
You can mix and match languages, so for Feb, do 3 in F# and 2 in Elixir, etc. So if you’d previously completed a Functional February exercise in F# in 2022, but you want to make it count for 2023, solve the same exercise in Elixir or one of the others (note that you can “Disable Learning Mode” - look for the ... button on the track page - if you don’t want to work through the whole syllabus, although we already recommend syllabuses if you have the time! 🙂)
The correct language/exercise pairs to earn the badge can be found in month sections above 👆👆👆
